# Nemesis Hybrid Engine

Nemesis Hybrid Engine is a controller app that enables the user to change SystemUI elements at runtime, using Broadcast intents. This is only meant for use by ROM developers. You must inject the custom view elements in the SystemUI layouts before building your ROM to enable the working of the Hybrid Engine.
